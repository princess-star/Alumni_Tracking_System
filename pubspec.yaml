  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see

  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: nsb
      fonts:
        - asset: res/font/Noto_Sans_Buhid.ttf
